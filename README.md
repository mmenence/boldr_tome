terraria mod with multiple examples of items and enemies 


simply an upload of my first mod, examples of most common ways of modding the game can be found here with varying degrees of quality, given that this was both my first experiance with modding terraria and the mod that i would change whenever i wanted to test something after i gained more experiance.
hopefully you can learn a trick or two from my old code
